    <h1><center>About Us</center></h1>
      <p><center>When immigrants and refugees come to Washington, most will try to assimilate to American culture. This makes it even more difficult to maintain ties to one’s ethnic culture. That’s when Eat Your Culture will come into play. Our website will connect Washington immigrants/refugees to resources such as ethnic restaurants and grocery stores in Washington which provide immigrants a sense of home. It will also provide users the opportunity to learn about various cultures through food- something we can all relate to and enjoy.</center></p><br><br><br>
